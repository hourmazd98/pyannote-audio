We introduce pyannote.audio, an open-source toolkit,
written in Python for speaker diarization.
Based on PyTorch,
machine learning framework, it provides a set of trainable
end-to-end neural building blocks that can be combined
and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization pipelines.
pyannote.audio also comes with pre-trained models covering,
a wide range of domains for voice activity detection,
speaker change detection, overlapped speech detection, and
speaker embedding â€“ reaching state-of-the-art performance
for most of them.
